Run on server chips made up for weak consumer demand

Apr 08,2020

Samsung Electronics announced better-than-expected profits for the first quarter in a preliminary earnings forecast released on Tuesday as robust chip sales offset losses from declining sales of smartphones and other consumer electronics in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

<img src="samsuag.jpg" width="450">Korean tech giant said that its operating profit will likely rise 2.73 percent to 6.4 trillion won ($5.2 billion) during the January-March period compared to the same period last year.

That estimate was higher than the average market consensus of 6.09 trillion won compiled by financial information services provider FnGuide as of April 6.<a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200407052800017?input=1195mtarget=r"target=_blank" title="samsuag new">

Revenue is expected to increase 4.98 percent on year to reach 55 trillion won, Samsung said, which was in line with market expectations.</a>

Analysts and market trackers said the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer fared relatiely well in the first quarter thanks to its chip business.

Chipmakers including Samsung enjoyed a surge in demand in the first three months of the year as clients started stacking up inventory, along with an increased demand for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips for servers.

Demand for server DRAM is spiking because of so many people working from home around the world and increased online content consumption due to the coronavirus.

Prices of DRAMs rose this year after hitting bottom last year.</P>
